Stepehgen Curry smashed the one-year record for 3-pointers in 2015-16 (400)
Most of the all-time leaders of 3-pointers are current players or recently retired (exception of Reggie Miller)
The 1994 ruke to allow 3-pointers 3 foul shots have made it even more attractive

3-pointers are a lower percentage shot for all players; however this is balanced by the fact they give a higher number of points for achieving them. Therefore we must normalize this by  multiplying the point total (2 or 3) by the percentgae made. 

For example, 40% of making a 3-pointer has a value of 1.2 points. A 50% of making a 2-pointer has a value of 1 point. If a player has 50% of making 2-pointer and 50% chance of 3-pointer he would be more productive focusing on 3-pointers. 

Kob'e shot data is public was taken from a Kaggle competition 
No stistical analysis was performed on the data. The goal of this project was ot provide visual data only to provide conclusions

The goal of the data is to asner some questions about Kobe and general shooting strategy. 

- If Kobe were to come out of retirement and play in the 2016-17 season, how should he focus on his game?
- Is Kobe more productive with 2 or 3-pointers overall? When distance from basket is taken into account how does this analysis change?
- Should his 3-point attempts depend on various game factor, such as opponent, shot type, or period of play?

Conclusions
- Kobe
